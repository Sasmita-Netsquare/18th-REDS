              Saudi Arabiaâ€™s Real Estate Market size is estimated at USD 69.51
              billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 101.62 billion by
              2029. Saudi Arabia has identified housing, tourism and commercial
              as some of its key projects under Vision 2030. As the demand
              continues to surpass supply in these sectors, owners, developers,
              operators, contractors, architects, designers and consultants are
              working wonders to create projects of the future, projects that
              redefine human limitations, projects that push the boundaries of
              possibilities. What they need are, right partners and products to
              count on.
